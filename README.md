A combination x-carriage + extruder for prusa i3-like printers.

Configured to direct-drive 3mm filament.  Note that you'll likely want to use a 0.9 degree (400-step) motor to have sufficient steps/mm.

Is parametric, should be able to change it to 1.75mm filament if you so desire -- see 'filament_diam' variable.
