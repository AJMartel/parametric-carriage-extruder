This is an *UNTESTED* work in progress of a NEMA14 geared extruder for 3mm filament, inspired by kliment's and sgraber's compact i3 extruder.

# Why?

* I have a bunch of left over NEMA14 motors from my terrible emaker huxley indiegogo kit
* My NEMA14 motors are almost half the weight of my NEMA17 motors -- faster movement?
* Faster to print than the kliment/sgraber (hopefully)
* I still have a lot of 3mm filament
* The parametric design should allow for NEMA17 version, 5mm shaft, 6mm shaft, 8mm shaft
* It's a challenge!
